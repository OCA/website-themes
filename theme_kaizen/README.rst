Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Following developments still could be made on this theme:

* Odoo supports automatic generation of a 5-color color scheme (alpha-epsilon) from a single chosen color (alpha). This theme is currently not using this feature and all colors are manually chosen (we are using alpha only, and then some custom-named colors).
* Currently this theme is just unloading any Google fonts and loading the Ubuntu font. It would be good to load more fonts and then adjust the Theme customization dialog to support choosing different fonts.
